# Sound Effects

This folder should contain the following sound files for the portfolio:

1. `hover.mp3` - Short, subtle sound for button/link hover
2. `click.mp3` - Click/tap sound effect
3. `levelup.mp3` - Level up or achievement sound
4. `boot_sequence.mp3` - System boot/startup sound

## Tips:
- Keep files small (under 100KB each)
- Use short sounds (under 1 second for hover/click)
- Match the cyberpunk/gaming theme of the portfolio

The website will work without these files (no errors), but sounds won't play.
